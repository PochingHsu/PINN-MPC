# PINN Based Model Predictive Control of Single Zone Building
In this study, we developed Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model for a single zone building. The developed model is used as the prediction model in the Model Predictive Controller (MPC). For MPC, Neural Generalized Predictive Control (NGPC), which uses Newton-Raphson to optimize the parameters within control horizon, is built from scratch by refering [1]
